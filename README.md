# myRetail RESTful Service
myRetail is a RESTful service that can retrieve product and price details by ID.

A live demo can be seen [here](https://lelton-myretail.herokuapp.com/#!/).

## Built With
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* Express
* AngularJS
* Node.js
* AngularJS Material

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

### Installing
* Clone repository from Github.
* Run ```npm install```
* Start mongo if not running already by using ```mongod```
* Run ```npm start```
* Copy and paste ```myretail.js``` file to setup basic mock data.

## Notes
* "The Big Lebowski (Blu Ray)" is the only information on the home page pulling in from the API, the rest is mock data from the NoSQL database.

## Base Functionality
- [x] Responds to an HTTP GET request at /products/{id} and delivers product data as JSON. 
- [x] Performs an HTTP GET to retrieve the product name from an external API.
- [x] Reads pricing information from a NoSQL data store and combines it with the product id and name from the HTTP request into a single response.

## Stretch Goals
- [ ] Accepts an HTTP PUT request at the same path (/products/{id}), containing a JSON request body similar to the GET response, and updates the productâ€™s price in the data store.
