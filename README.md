## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

<!-- ### Installing -->

## Base Functionality
- [ ] Responds to an HTTP GET request at /products/{id} and delivers product data as JSON. 
- [ ] Performs an HTTP GET to retrieve the product name from an external API.
- [ ] Reads pricing information from a NoSQL data store and combines it with the product id and name from the HTTP request into a single response.

## Stretch Goals
- [ ] Accepts an HTTP PUT request at the same path (/products/{id}), containing a JSON request body similar to the GET response, and updates the productâ€™s price in the data store.
